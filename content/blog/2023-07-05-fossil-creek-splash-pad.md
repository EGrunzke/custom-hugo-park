G﻿o to Fossil Creek Lake Pavilion #2 in maps,﻿ that'll take you to the right parking lot. Then walk down the sidewalk along the left/north side of the lake until you find the hidden splash pad. The splash pad is NOT next to the playground like other parks.

Bathrooms are a short walk toward the pavilion. 

The Fossil Creek Splash Pad is a hidden gem of Ft. Collins, especially perfect for littles as it's gentler than others. Kiddos enjoy scooping water out of the rock basin, bringing Solo cups or buckets works well for them.

Since it's right near the lake, bug spray is usually helpful!
