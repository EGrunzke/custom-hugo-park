Join us at English Ranch Park. Easiest parking is on the east side along the street. Bathrooms are close to the playground. Sand playground (sand toys!).

Look for the giant red horse.

Eat an early picnic lunch, then head over to Council Tree Library at 11 am for their toddler or 4-year-old+ story times. We like to go to Mary's Mountain Cookies to get their day-olds afterwards!
