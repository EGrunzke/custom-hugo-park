Cï»¿ome to Fossil Creek Playground, also known "the big yellow slide park" in our family! We \*were\* going to go to Windsor Swim Beach, but Fort Collins weather likes to keep us on our toes ðŸ˜‚

Tï»¿his is yet another one of Fort Collins wonderful parks. Playground has a huge mammoth to climb on, little tots play structure, and other great things. There's a skate park adjacent to playground, dog park nearby, and a hockey rink.
