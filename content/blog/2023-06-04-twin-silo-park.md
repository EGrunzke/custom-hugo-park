Twin Silo Park is a kiddo's dream. High places to climb, a gigantic slide to slide down. Older kids might want to do the skate park nearby.

There is also a creek area built out for kids to play in. We're not sure how high or fast the water will be this year but it's pretty shallow in some spots. We recommend a sun umbrella for creek time as there's no shade for parents.

Bathrooms are close to the playground.
